## Over View
Project Illumination is a blog that my friend and I are collaborating on. We are going to develop and deploy a blog for our hobbies and passions. Simply, a place to document our interests and to share our experiences.

This project is to practice and implement our learnings. The main focus is the development process and collaborating with someone is like.

Simultaneously, we will be writing documentation and content for this blog as we build it.

The goal? To learn and gain experience.
